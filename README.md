# Number-Guessing-Game
The number-guessing game in Python challenges players to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 in 10 attempts or less. The program provides feedback on each guess, guiding players to find the correct number while maintaining a fun and interactive guessing experience.

Project Name: Number Guessing Game

Objective: The objective of a number-guessing game is for the player to correctly guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game typically provides feedback on each guess, helping the player refine their subsequent guesses. The ultimate goal is to deduce and identify the correct number within a limited number of attempts.

Key Features: Key features of a number guessing game typically include:
1. Random Number Generation: The game generates a random number within a specified range.
2. User Input: Players input their guesses to try and identify the generated number.
3. Feedback: The game provides feedback on each guess, indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. Limited Attempts: Players usually have a set number of attempts to guess the correct number, adding a challenge.
5. Winning Condition: The game concludes when the player correctly guesses the number or exhausts their allowed attempts.
6. User Interaction: The game engages users with prompts, messages, and a dynamic interface to create an interactive experience.
7. Scalability: Parameters such as the range of numbers and the number of attempts are often adjustable for customization.
8. Error Handling: The program handles invalid inputs, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience.
These features collectively contribute to the entertainment and challenge of the number-guessing game.

Advanced Features: Advanced features can enhance the gameplay and user experience in a number-guessing game. Here are some advanced features you could consider adding:
1. Difficulty Levels: Implement different difficulty settings with varying ranges or complexities to cater to players with different skill levels.
2. Score System: Introduce a scoring mechanism based on factors like the number of attempts or time taken, encouraging players to improve their performance.
3. Hints: Provide optional hints to players, such as whether the correct number is even or odd, or if it is a multiple of a certain number.
4. Multiplayer Mode: Enable a multiplayer mode where players can compete against each other to guess the correct number first.
5. Sound Effects and Graphics: Incorporate sound effects and visually appealing graphics to enhance the gaming experience.
6. Save/Load Game: Allow players to save their progress and resume the game later, adding a sense of continuity.
7. Leaderboard: Implement a leaderboard to showcase high scores, promoting friendly competition among players.
8. Customization: Let players customize aspects of the game, such as the range of numbers, background themes, or the appearance of the interface.
9. Story Mode: Introduce a storyline or thematic elements to make the game more immersive and engaging.
10. Achievements: Include a system of achievements or badges that players can unlock based on specific accomplishments during the game.
These advanced features can make the number-guessing game more dynamic, enjoyable, and replayable for users. Consider incorporating them based on the complexity and scope you want for your game.

Submission:
1. Open your favorite Python development environment or a text editor.
2. Copy the entire provided code.
3. Paste the code into a new Python file with a .py extension, for example, number_guessing_game.py.
4. Save the file.

Testing:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you saved the Python file.
3. Run the script using the command python number_guessing_game.py (or the appropriate command based on your Python environment).

 
The game will start, and you'll be prompted to choose a difficulty level. You can type 'easy', 'medium', or 'hard'. If you have a saved game, you'll be given the option to resume it.
Play the game by entering your guesses. The game provides feedback on each guess and tracks your score. If you correctly guess the number within the allowed attempts, it will congratulate you and display your score.
Feel free to explore different difficulty levels, and if you need to save your progress, you can choose to do so when prompted.
Remember that the pickle module is used for saving and loading game progress, so make sure that your environment supports it.
If you encounter any issues or have questions about specific parts of the code, feel free to ask for further assistance!
